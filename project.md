${{ content_synopsis }} This image will run Prometheus [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) and [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md), for maximum security and performance. You can either provide your own config file or configure Prometheus directly inline in your compose. If you run the compose example, you can open the following [URL](http://localhost:3000/query?g0.expr=histogram_quantile%280.9%2C+sum+by+%28le%29+%28rate%28dnspyre_dns_requests_duration_seconds_bucket%5B1m%5D%29%29%29&g0.show_tree=0&g0.tab=graph&g0.range_input=1m&g0.res_type=auto&g0.res_density=medium&g0.display_mode=lines&g0.show_exemplars=0) to see the statistics of your DNS benchmark just like in the screenshot.
